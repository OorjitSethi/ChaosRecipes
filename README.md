# Recipe for Chaos

**Welcome to the factory where the rules are rewritten every turn.**

**Recipe for Chaos** is a fast-paced, competitive economic game for 3–8 players where **adaptation is your greatest asset**. It's not just about what you can build—it's about whether you can build it in a world where the market, the recipes, and even your objectives are in constant flux.

At its heart, this is a race. But your racetrack is a living economy, and the finish line keeps moving.

## The AI Game Master

The core of the chaos is an **AI Game Master** that monitors the state of play. Each turn, it introduces new _World Events_, ensuring **no two games are ever alike**.

Examples of AI-driven world events:
- _"A trade embargo is enacted! Silicon prices have doubled this turn!"_
- _"A manufacturing breakthrough means Microchips are cheaper to craft!"_
- _"A freighter needs repairs! The first player to sell 2 Casings to the market gets a massive coin bonus."_

These events aren’t just random—they create a **narrative**. A price surge might last several turns, only to collapse when the AI announces that “new supply lines have opened.” Your long-term strategy must account for a market **with a memory**.
