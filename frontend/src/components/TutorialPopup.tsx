                    <p>
                        At the start of the game, you are secretly assigned a unique <strong>Gadget</strong> to build. Your goal is displayed in your Player Info panel. To build it, you must first craft its two required <strong>Complex Components</strong>.
                    </p>

                    <SectionHeader>The Core Loop</SectionHeader>
                    <p>
                        Each turn, you can perform actions like buying, selling, crafting, and trading. When you are done, click <strong>End Turn</strong>. The next turn will only begin once all players are ready. But don't take too longâ€”a timer deducts coins from players who are still "thinking"!
                    </p>

                    <SectionHeader>The Market & Crafting</SectionHeader>
                    <ul className="list-disc list-inside space-y-2">
                        <li><strong>Base Ingredients:</strong> Carbon, Silicon, and Polymer can be bought from or sold to the central market.</li>
                        <li><strong>Complex Components:</strong> Items like Microchips and Casings cannot be bought. You must craft them using Base Ingredients, as shown in the Crafting panel.</li>
                        <li><strong>The AI Game Master:</strong> The market is alive! Each turn, an AI introduces events that can dramatically change prices or crafting recipes. An event that raises prices might last for several turns before expiring.</li>
                    </ul>

                    <SectionHeader>Trading</SectionHeader>
                    <p>
                        The market isn't your only option. Use the <strong>Trading Post</strong> to propose direct trades with other players. This is essential for getting what you need when the market is unfavorable or a resource is scarce. You can offer any combination of items and coins.
                    </p>

                    <SectionHeader>Winning the Game</SectionHeader>
                    <p>
                        Once you have both required Complex Components in your inventory, click the big <strong>BUILD!</strong> button in the Crafting panel. The first player to do so wins the game.
